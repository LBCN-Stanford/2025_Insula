Annotations for trialinfo (trial information) table 
* stim - words for stimulus
* valence - originally defined valence
* allonsets - timestamps of stimulus onset (second, time locked to the recording onset)
* emo_time - timestamps of valence judgement onset (second, time locked to the recording onset)
* emo_rate - valence judgements. 7: (+3); 6: (+2); 5: (+1); 4: (0); 3: (-1); 2: (-2); 1: (-3)
* emo_RT - reaction times for judgements (second)
* recall_start - timestamps of free recall phase (second, time locked to the recording onset)
* number_counting - timestamps of distraction (second, time locked to the recording onset)
* SelfValence - self-evaluated valence


* recall_onset - onset of free recall
* recall_offset - offset of free recall
Timestamps for onset and offset of free recall were generated by WhisperAI ASR model (https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped) and then manually checked. (0 values mean corresponding words were non-recalled).
